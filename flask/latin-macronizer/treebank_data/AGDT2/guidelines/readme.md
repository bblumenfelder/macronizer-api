## README

This folder contains the guidelines used to treebank the texts of the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2. They expand the <a href="http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/greekguidelines.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines for the Syntactic Annotation of the Ancient Greek Dependecy Treebank (1.1)</a>, by refining the morphosyntactic annotation and adding a semantic layer. The latter is build on the categories identified in H. W. Smyth's <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007" target="_blank">Greek Grammar</a>.

Two formats for the guidelines are available: 

```
1. html 
2. md 
```
The html version is the standard one that should be used for treebanking: it has to be downloaded and consulted in a browser. The md version is made available only for quick reference on Github, not requiring download.

Please quote the guidelines in the following way:
